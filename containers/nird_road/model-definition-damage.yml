    This model estimates the direct road damage caused by flood by integrating
    asset-specific damage curves and costs. It considers different road asset types
    (e.g., bridges, tunnels, and ordinary roads), reflecting variations in construction
    and repair expenses. Additionally, the model incorporates flood-specific flow
    conditions, accounting for different flood types such as river floods, surface
    floods, and coastal floods. By applying tailored damage curves for each asset type
    and flood condition, the model provides a detailed assessment of infrastructure
    vulnerability and expected repair/reconstruction costs.

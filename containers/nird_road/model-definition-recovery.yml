  description: >
    This model dynamically evaluate indirect damages by designing various road capacity
    recovery rates, accounting for road types and damage levels. The recovery process
    identifies disrupted flows resulting from missing routes or reduced speeds, and
    reallocates these flows as road capacities are restored on a daily basis. The
    analysis captures the evolving number of isolated flows, rerouting costs and asset
    repair costs, offering a more realistic representation of dynamic indirect damages.
